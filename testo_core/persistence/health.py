    Each stage dict has ``total_tests``/``passed``/``failed``/``broken``/
    ``skipped``/``health_pct`` keyed by ``name`` so callers can merge it into
    their existing per-stage metadata. The overall figure is a single
    weighted pass rate (sum of passed / sum of total across every stage),
    not an average of per-stage percentages. Returns ``(per_stage, None)``
    when no stage produced any parseable Allure results, so callers can fall
    back to a returncode-based estimate instead of reporting a misleading 0%.

    A stage that failed without producing any results (e.g. it crashed at
    startup) has no pass rate of its own, and leaving it out would report a
    broken cycle as 100% healthy. The overall pass rate is therefore scaled
    by the share of stages that did not crash this way: one healthy stage and
    one crashed stage give 50%.
