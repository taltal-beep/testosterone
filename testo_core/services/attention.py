"""What needs someone now, across every cycle: the dashboard's first card.

For each cycle's latest run: is it red (and since when, with how many new
failures), which tests it made flaky, and which tests got slower. Built from
the same services as the run page (:mod:`~testo_core.services.run_failures`),
the flaky card (:mod:`~testo_core.services.flaky_service`) and the cycle page's
"Got slower" list (:mod:`~testo_core.services.test_history`), so the dashboard
never says something those pages don't.
