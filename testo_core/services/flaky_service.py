"""Flaky test detection over a cycle's run history.

A test is flaky, across the last ``window`` runs of a cycle, when any of these hold:

* **Passed on retry.** It failed and then passed inside one run (JUnit reruns,
  Surefire ``flakyFailure``, pytest-rerunfailures; ``statusDetails.flaky`` in the
  run's results). The code didn't change between attempts, so the test is unreliable.
* **Same commit, both outcomes.** It passed in one run and failed in another run
  of the same commit.
* **Flips on one branch.** On one branch it both passed and failed and its
  outcome flipped at least twice. Flips are counted per branch, so a pull request
  that broke a test and then fixed it, between passing runs on ``main``, is not
  flaky. One flip is a plain regression or fix, which Compare already shows.

A test that failed in each of its last :data:`BROKEN_STREAK` runs on its latest
branch is **broken**, not flaky: it is listed in :attr:`FlakyReport.broken`
instead, because quarantining or retrying it would hide a real failure.

Per-test outcomes come from the ``test_result`` rows each run stores
(:mod:`testo_core.history.cases`; older runs are read from their artifact
snapshot once and stored), so this works on every database backend. The CLI (``testo flaky``) and the API (``/analytics/flaky``) both call
:func:`find_flaky_tests`.
