"""The failing tests of one run, for the run page: what failed, since when, and why.

Per-test outcomes come from each run's artifact snapshot (the Allure
``*-result.json`` files), the same source Compare and flaky detection read, so
this needs no schema change and works for engine and ingested runs alike.

For each failing test it reports whether it is new against the run's baseline
(the latest run on a pull request's target branch, else the run before on the
same branch, as in the PR comment), how many runs in a row it has been failing
on this branch (``failing_runs``), whether it is flaky in the cycle's recent
history, and the first line of its failure message. Tests that
fail with the same message are grouped, so ten tests that all hit
``ConnectionRefusedError`` read as one cause, not ten. A cause someone marked
for a message (:mod:`~testo_core.services.triage`) rides along on each test
that fails with it.
