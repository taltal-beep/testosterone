"""Find every test suite in a repository, folder by folder (``testo init --scan``).

Plain ``testo init`` reads the project files at the top of the repository
(:func:`testo_core.services.project_setup.detect_project`). A monorepo keeps
them lower down: ``api/pyproject.toml``, ``web/package.json``,
``services/billing/go.mod``. :func:`scan_repo` walks the folders, runs the
same detection in each folder that has a project file, and gives back one
:class:`FoundStage` per runner per folder, with ``target_repo`` set so the
stage starts in its folder.

Only files are read; nothing is run. Two folders can name the same tests (a
Maven parent and its modules, a root Jest config and a workspace package);
the rules in :func:`_covered_by` keep the outer one and say so.
