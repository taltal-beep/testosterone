"""Split a suite into shards that take about the same time, from the times history stored.

Used by ``testo split`` and ``pytest --testo-shard I/N``. A test's weight is its
median duration over the cycle's recent runs (:mod:`testo_core.services.test_history`,
or the team server's ``GET /api/v1/analytics/tests``). Tests with no history weigh
the median of the known ones, so with no history at all the split is round robin.

Shards are filled longest test first, each test going to the shard with the least
time so far (the "longest processing time" rule: never worse than 4/3 of the best
split). The split depends only on the set of tests and their times, not their order;
inside a shard, tests keep the order they were given in.
