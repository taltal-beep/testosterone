"""Ask about your tests: a question in plain words, answered from the recorded history.

The configured AI provider gets the same evidence the project review reads
(:func:`~testo_core.services.project_review.history_evidence`: per-cycle
results, failing tests and their messages, flaky, slow and slower tests, test
names, churn) plus the question and the last few turns of the conversation.
It never reads source code, and it is told to answer only from that evidence
and to say when the evidence doesn't hold the answer.

Nothing is stored: the conversation lives in the page, which sends its recent
turns back with each question. Each question costs one provider call.
