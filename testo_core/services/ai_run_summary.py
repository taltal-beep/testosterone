"""One failed run's AI summary for the CLI and the pull request comment.

The same :class:`~testo_core.services.failure_analysis_service.FailureAnalysisService`
the API uses, with the settings from :func:`~testo_core.services.ai.cli_settings.settings_store`,
so a summary made here is stored with the run and the UI shows it too.
