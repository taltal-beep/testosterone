"""Order a suite so the tests most likely to fail run first, from the shared run history.

Used by ``pytest --testo-failed-first``. pytest's own ``--ff`` reads one machine's
cache; this reads the cycle's recent runs (on this machine, or on the team
server), so a fresh CI runner also puts last run's failures first and a red
build turns red in its first minute.

A test's rank, lowest first:

0. it failed (or broke) in the latest run it was in;
1. it is flaky (passed and failed, flipping, over the window);
2. it failed at least once in the window;
3. everything else, including tests with no history.

The sort is stable, so inside a rank tests keep the order they were collected in.
Nothing is skipped: only the order changes.
