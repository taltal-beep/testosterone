"""Project health: a repeatable score for the tests of the project Testosterone tests.

Not a score of Testosterone itself. Each signal is computed from data the
history already has, the same data the dashboard, the cycle page and the flaky
card show, so the page never says something those pages don't:

* **Passing tests**: share of tests passing in each cycle's latest run.
* **Green builds**: share of each cycle's recent runs that passed.
* **Stable tests**: share of tests that are not flaky
  (:mod:`~testo_core.services.flaky_service`).
* **Speed trend**: share of tests that did not get slower
  (:mod:`~testo_core.services.test_history`).
* **Test hygiene**: share of tests neither skipped nor quarantined.
* **Test pyramid**: the shape of the unit / integration / e2e tiers
  (:mod:`~testo_core.reporting.pyramid_viz`).

The overall score is the weighted mean of the signals that have data. The same
history always gives the same score: no AI is involved. The optional AI review
lives in :mod:`~testo_core.services.project_review`.
