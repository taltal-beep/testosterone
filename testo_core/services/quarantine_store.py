"""Quarantine kept in the run-history database, set from the UI, the API or ``testo quarantine``.

The ``quarantine:`` list in ``testosterone.yaml`` needs a config file and a
code review, which ``testo ingest`` and ``pytest --testo`` users often don't
have. This list lives next to the runs (table ``quarantined_test``), one entry
per cycle and test, and is added to the cycle's config rules wherever a run is
judged: :meth:`~testo_core.services.cycle_run.CycleRunService.run` (``testo run``,
``testo ingest``, the server's ingest route, API runs) and the pytest plugin.
The gate itself is the same one as for config rules
(:mod:`testo_core.engine.quarantine`): mute, not skip.

An entry whose test is an exact name (no glob characters) is released on its
own once the test passed each of its last :func:`release_after` runs of the
cycle (``TESTO_QUARANTINE_RELEASE_AFTER``, default 10, ``0`` turns it off).
A retried pass doesn't count. Glob entries stay until someone removes them.

Everything that reads the list from a run is best-effort: a database error is
logged once and the run goes on with the config rules alone.
