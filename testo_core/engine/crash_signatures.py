"""Spot stack overflows and hard crashes in test output.

A test that recurses forever, or native code that dies on a bad pointer, fails
in a way that reads like any other red test unless someone opens the log. Each
runtime prints a very specific line when its stack overflows, so a short table
of patterns is enough to name the cause:

* :class:`CrashScanner` reads an engine stage's live output (the executor feeds
  it every chunk it writes to ``run.log``).
* :func:`crash_in_text` classifies a failing test's message and trace, which
  works for imported results (JUnit, Jest, go test, TRX, ...) as well.
* :func:`crash_from_returncode` names a process killed by a crash signal
  (``SIGSEGV`` and friends, or the Windows stack-overflow status).

Only failures are classified: a test that expects ``RecursionError`` and passes
is never flagged. See ``docs/Specs & ADRs/Crash Detection - 2026-10-31.md``.
