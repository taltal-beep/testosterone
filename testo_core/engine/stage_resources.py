"""A stage's ``resources:``: lease keys for it, or hand its workers what they need to lease their own.

Called by :mod:`testo_core.engine.executor` before the stage's process starts:

- ``per: stage``: Testosterone waits for one key, the process gets ``TESTO_RESOURCE_ID``
  and friends, and the key goes back when the process ends.
- ``per: worker`` / ``per: test``: each test process leases its own key. The stage
  passes the pool down in ``TESTO_RESOURCE_SPEC`` (the pytest plugin acts on it; any
  other runner can call ``testo lease run "$TESTO_RESOURCE_POOL" -- ...``), plus where
  the leases live (this machine's database, or ``TESTO_SERVER_URL``).
- ``workers: auto``: the stage starts as many workers as the pool has free keys.

See :mod:`testo_core.resources` and docs/Processes & Guides/Shared Resource Pools.md.
