"""Generic ``command`` adapter — run any test runner as a stage.

The stage's ``args`` are the complete argv (``["npx", "jest", "--ci"]``,
``["npx", "playwright", "test"]``, ``["maestro", "test", "flows/"]``). Nothing
is injected: such runners don't speak Allure, so their results arrive through
the stage's ``junit_xml`` globs, which the executor converts into Allure
result files after the process exits (:mod:`testo_core.reporting.junit_import`).
The Allure results dir is still exported as ``TESTO_SHARED_ALLURE_RESULTS_DIR``
for runners that can write Allure JSON themselves.
