"""Schema migrations for the run history database (Alembic, run in-process).

Every table Testosterone owns is described twice: by the SQLModel classes in
:mod:`testo_core.repository.models`, which the code reads and writes through,
and by the revision scripts in ``versions/``, which are the only thing that
changes a database that already has data. ``SQLModel.metadata.create_all()`` is
no longer called on a real database: :func:`upgrade_to_head` is.

Rules:

- A model change ships with a revision in the same pull request. The test
  ``tests/unit/testo_core/repository/test_migrations.py`` compares the two and
  fails when they differ.
- Databases created by ``create_all()`` before revision ``0001`` existed (every
  install up to 1.5.0) have the tables but no ``alembic_version`` row. Revision
  ``0001`` adopts them: it creates only the tables and columns that are missing
  (with defaults, so old rows stay valid) instead of failing on the ones that
  exist, and the later revisions apply as usual. Nothing is lost and nobody
  runs a command by hand.
- Several processes may start on one database at once (parallel CI workers
  leasing keys, ``testo run`` next to ``testo-api``). The first one upgrades;
  the others see a database error, find the schema already at head and go on.
- New revisions: ``python scripts/db_revision.py "add x to y"`` writes the
  script from the model diff; read it before committing, autogenerate misses
  renames and server defaults.
