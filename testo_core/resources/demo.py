"""Made-up pools and leases, so the Resources page has something to show.

``testo lease demo`` writes them into this machine's lease database, and the
static demo site (``scripts/export_static_site.py --demo-resources``) freezes
them. Nothing here is real: the "VMs", "phones" and holders are invented, and
the leases live a week so the page stays filled while you look around.
