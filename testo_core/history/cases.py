"""One run's tests, for the analytics: from the ``test_result`` table, else its snapshot.

Runs recorded since revision ``0003`` have rows written by ``DbBackend``. Older
runs have only their Allure snapshot on disk; the first read parses it and
stores the rows, so the next read is a query and the API no longer needs the
run's files for flaky detection, per-test history or failures.
