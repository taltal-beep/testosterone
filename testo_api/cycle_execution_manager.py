    Manage plan/cycle executions using the modern engine lifecycle:

    - `discover_and_load` config discovery + `resolve_plan` (a named cycle), or
      `single_stage_plan` (an ad-hoc run of one framework, see `create_adhoc_execution`)
    - `CycleRunService.run()`, the same use case as `testo run`: trigger gate
      (`cycle_trigger` NDJSON event), `orchestrator.run_plan()` writing durable NDJSON
      into `artifacts/<cycle>/events.ndjson`, reporters and the report archive

    Streaming is done by tailing `events.ndjson` from a recorded byte offset.

    Executions run on a fixed pool of `max_concurrent` worker threads (default from
    `TESTO_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS`). A new execution is accepted at once with status
    `queued` and waits in a FIFO queue until a worker is free; one cycle still can't
    be queued or running twice. With `TESTO_RUN_QUEUE=memory` (the default) a restart
    drops queued runs; with `db` they are kept as rows and `recover_queued()` queues
    them again on startup (see `testo_api.run_queue`).

    The registry is bounded: every running execution is kept, plus the last
    `max_finished` finished ones (default from `TESTO_MAX_FINISHED_EXECUTIONS`).
    Older finished executions are evicted and their status/events endpoints answer
    404; their results stay in the run history (`/api/v1/runs`).
