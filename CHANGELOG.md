All notable changes to `testo-core` will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

---

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Compare showed "n/a" / "Unknown" for "Test time (sum)" and "Avg per test" on every run because nothing stored them. Both persistence backends now write `metrics_duration_ms` (sum of per-test Allure durations) and `avg_case_ms` (that sum over the test count, `null` with no tests), plus `test_time_ms` per stage. Runs saved earlier still show "n/a". A new contract test fails when `history/views.py` reads a run metadata key that persistence never writes

### Changed
- Pages demo: the read-only notice is now a dismissible alert with a × button, remembered across reloads, and a "Read-only demo" badge in the header reopens it
- Detailed architecture diagram (`docs/assets/testosterone-architecture-detailed-{dark,light}.png`, drawn by `scripts/render_architecture_diagram.js`) showing `CycleRunService`, the `history/` read side and the repository; it replaces the six-box picture in the README and leads `docs/Architecture/System Diagram.md`
- Docs vault: the architecture diagram now has its own note (`docs/Architecture/System Diagram.md`) so it shows in Obsidian and the GitHub wiki, not only the README; Architecture Overview's text sketch is a Mermaid flowchart. New decision note for the vault and wiki sync, the second wave of the 2026-10-07 interview fixes, and this repo's workflows in CI-CD Pipeline Setup. `scripts/docs_vault.py lint --base` accepts a second edit to a note already dated today

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-07

One engine behind every surface. The Docker-based second execution stack, the Streamlit UI, MinIO and the `uqo` command are gone; the CLI, the API and CI all run cycles through `CycleRunService`. The release also adds an API security model, a type-checked API, same-cycle run comparison and a read-only demo on GitHub Pages. Upgrading from 1.0: see "Migrating from v1.0" in the README.

### Added
- Docs vault rules: `docs/CLAUDE.md` (schema), `docs/log.md`, frontmatter on every note, and `scripts/docs_vault.py lint` (frontmatter, broken links, wikilinks, orphans, `updated` date on edited notes) as a `docs_vault` CI job and a contract test. `.github/workflows/wiki-sync.yml` regenerates the GitHub wiki from `docs/` on every push to `main` that touches the vault. The root `CLAUDE.md` gains the six second-brain rules, and `docs/Specs & ADRs/` gains decision notes for the 2026-10-06 architecture consolidation and the 2026-10-07 interview fixes
- Pages demo on GitHub and GitLab: `.github/workflows/pages-demo.yml` (GitHub Pages, `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/`) and `.gitlab-ci.yml` (GitLab Pages) each run testosterone's own suite (`self-test` cycle) and the deliberately broken [fake-api](https://github.com/taltal-beep/fake-api) app (`fake-api` cycle), then publishes the React UI as a read-only snapshot of those runs (`scripts/export_static_site.py` freezes the API's own responses; `frontend/src/lib/static-backend.ts` serves them to the unchanged pages). Run history is cached between pipelines. `.github/workflows/mirror-to-gitlab.yml` mirrors `main` to GitLab, inert until configured
- `frontend` CI job in `ci.yml`: runs the React dashboard's typecheck, vitest suite and production build on every PR (the frontend had no CI coverage)
- `POST /api/v1/adhoc-executions`: run one framework (`pytest`, `behave`, `behavex`, `command`) against a repo without defining a cycle. It runs as a one-stage `adhoc` cycle through `CycleRunService`, with status and SSE events under `/api/v1/cycle-executions/{id}`
- Quick Run page in the React frontend (`/quick-run`, under Advanced) built on that endpoint; it replaces the Legacy Execution page
- Engine run records now store failure evidence for failed runs (failing cases, first traceback, log tail, timeout flag; all redacted) for the AI failure summary, and CI provenance (`ci_provider`, `ci_pipeline_id`, `ci_job_id`, `ci_commit_sha`, `ci_ref_name`) when run in CI
- After every cycle run, test KPIs are pushed to InfluxDB and/or a Prometheus Pushgateway when `INFLUXDB_*` / `PROMETHEUS_PUSHGATEWAY_URL` are set

### Changed
- Loose `testo_core` root modules moved into their subpackages (no compatibility shims): `db.py` → `repository/db.py`, `db_config.py` → `repository/db_config.py`, `report_generator.py` / `metrics.py` / `metrics_extractor.py` / `integrations.py` → `reporting/`, `triggers.py` → `config/triggers.py`. Only the cross-cutting `paths.py` stays at the root
- CI type-checks `testo_api` as well as `testo_core` (`mypy testo_core testo_api`, blocking). The AI config routes validate their status payload through Pydantic, and report diffs type the change kind as a `Literal`
- Pages demo explains itself: the banner says it shows testosterone's self-test and fake-api (whose red is deliberate), only cycles that ran are exported and their Run buttons are disabled with the local `testo run` command, the read-only message no longer names GitLab, and with an optional `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` the export freezes an AI failure summary per failed run (otherwise the card says summaries are generated live)
- API access control: CORS now allows only the Vite dev/preview servers by default (`TESTO_CORS_ORIGINS`; credentials only for an explicit origin list, never with `*`) and mutating requests from other browser origins get `403`, optional `TESTO_API_TOKEN` requires a bearer token on mutating requests (the frontend sends `VITE_TESTO_API_TOKEN`), and `testo-api` warns when bound beyond loopback without a token. `ARCHITECTURE.md` gains "Security model" and "Trade-offs and known limits" sections
- Running a cycle (trigger gate, engine, reporters, native report snapshot, report archive, trigger snapshot) now lives in one application service, `testo_core/services/cycle_run.py` (`CycleRunService`). `testo run` and `POST /api/v1/cycles/{cycle}/executions` both call it, so the API no longer imports private helpers from `testo_core/cli/runner.py`
- API cycle executions now save the trigger snapshot after a successful triggered run, as `testo run` already did; before, a cycle with `trigger:` started from the dashboard never advanced its snapshot
- Frontend API types are now generated from FastAPI's OpenAPI schema (`frontend/openapi.json` → `frontend/src/lib/api-schema.ts`) instead of being hand-written; CI's `frontend` job runs `tsc` and fails on a stale schema or generated file
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `README.md` now describe the single execution engine (config → `CycleRunService` → engine → framework adapters → reporting/persistence) with a system diagram, layer table and the typed Pydantic-to-React contract
- `testo_core/run_history.py` is replaced by the `testo_core/history/` package: `views` (typed run views), `read_model` (queries), `report_links`, `snapshots` and `maintenance`. All of it goes through the run repository, which gains `merge_run_metadata()`; `STATIC_HISTORY_ROOT` moves to `testo_core.paths`
- GitHub Action and GitLab template now run `testo run --ci` (they called `uqo run --config … --ghost`, which v1.0's `uqo` alias no longer accepted). Action inputs are `config-path`, `cycle`, `ci-mode`, `persist`, `python-version`; `ghost-mode`, `stream-json`, `runner-image`, `runner-prebuilt` and the `run_id` output are gone. GitLab variables are now `TESTO_CONFIG_PATH`, `TESTO_CYCLE`, `TESTO_PERSIST`
- The React UI names runs by cycle and start time (`fake-api · Oct 7 03:21`) with the short run id as secondary text, on the Dashboard, Runs, Run detail and Compare pages; `GET /api/v1/dashboard/runs/recent` items now include `cycle`. Compare shows Reliability/Performance as tables with coloured deltas and state badges instead of raw `key=value` strings, and its run pickers are grouped and filterable by cycle
- CI's `format` job now blocks on `mypy testo_core` and `ruff format --check` (both were advisory); the codebase was reformatted once with `ruff format`, and a `ruff-format` pre-commit hook was added
- A stage's `workers` now does what it says, or says it doesn't: pytest stages get `-n <workers>` when pytest-xdist is installed for the `pytest` on PATH (otherwise one warning and a serial run), `workers:` on a behave or command stage logs a warning, and the API/UI only show workers for frameworks that use them
- CI's `test` job now enforces coverage (it ran `--no-cov`): `pytest.ini` measures `testo_core` and `testo_api` with branch coverage and fails below 65% (was 50%, `testo_core` only), and `coverage.xml` is uploaded as an artifact. `nightly-external`, `release-gate` and `pr-heavy` pass `--no-cov`: their few marker-selected tests could never meet that project-wide gate, which is why `nightly-external` failed every night. `nightly-external` also reads `TESTO_E2E_*` secrets instead of `UQO_E2E_*` and skips with a notice when none are set
- Renamed the remaining UQO names in code and UI to Testosterone: tab title, OpenAPI title (`Testosterone API`), and env vars `UQO_*` → `TESTO_*` (`TESTO_SHARED_ALLURE_RESULTS_DIR`, `TESTO_ARTIFACTS_ROOT`, `TESTO_LAST_TEST_TYPE`, `TESTO_RUN_ID`, `TESTO_E2E_*`, runner image build args) with no aliases for the old names. Defaults changed too: `PROMETHEUS_JOB_NAME` is `testo`, metrics are `testo_*` / `testo_test_run`, the default SQLite history file is `testo_history.db`, and the compose Postgres is `testo-postgres` / `testo_admin` / `testo_history`

### Removed
- MinIO support: the `s3` readiness check (`/api/v1/health/ready` reported "degraded" without MinIO credentials), `testo_core/s3_client.py`, `history/s3_snapshots.py` (pre-v1.1 snapshot reads), the pre-v1.1 record shape in `history/views.py`, the `boto3` dependency, and the `minio`, `minio-init`, `allure-sync` and `allure` compose services. `docker-compose.yml` now only provides Postgres
- The second, Docker-based execution stack: `HeadlessEngineService`, `testo_core/runners.py`, `command_builders.py`, `multi_run.py`, `event_drain.py`, `config_loader.py`, `audit_service.py`, `ghost_policy.py`, `result_management.py`, and the pluggy `orchestrator.py` / `specs.py` / `plugins_builtin.py`. Every run now goes through the cycle engine
- The v1.0 `uqo run --config <runs.yaml>` contract (`--ghost`, `--no-ghost`, `--json`, `--stream-json`, summary JSON); use `testo run --cycle <name> --ci`
- The `uqo` console script (`testo_core/cli/deprecated.py`) and the frontend's legacy route redirects (`/history`, `/runner`, `/execution`, `/advanced/execution`); use `testo` and the current routes. Unknown frontend paths now show a not-found page
- `POST /api/v1/executions`, `GET /api/v1/executions/{id}` and `GET /api/v1/executions/{id}/events`; use `POST /api/v1/adhoc-executions` or `POST /api/v1/cycles/{cycle}/executions`
- The Streamlit UI (`testo_ui/`, `testo-ui` script, `ui` extra), as scheduled in 1.0.0
- The `docker` extra and the `pluggy` runtime dependency
- Run-history writer functions in `run_history.py` (`create_run`, `record_completed_run`, MinIO uploads), the unused `compare_latest_two()` and the `db_path` arguments on history queries
- Generated run output that was committed by mistake (`artifacts/allure-report*`, `artifacts/allure-results-archive/`, `artifacts/metrics.json`); these paths are now ignored
- `testo_core/reporting/allure_delta_transform.py`, `allure_history_serve.py` and `allure_summary_widgets.py`: unreferenced modules that could not be imported (they depended on functions no longer in `services/report_archive_diff.py`)
- Dead code and test-failure injection: `.streamlit/`, `drop_in_hooks/`, `requirements.txt`, `deploy/nginx/`, `examples/gitlab/`, the unused GitLab tier templates, `sample_target_repo/random_fail.py` and the `sample-all-frameworks-stochastic` cycle, and the `UQO_FLAKY_DEMO` / `SANDBOX_API_FLAKY_P` switches in testosterone's own suite. `testo_core/sandbox_api.py` (a uvicorn launcher for the sample mock API, used only by one black-box test on a fixed port) is gone with that test, so it no longer ships in the wheel

### Fixed
- Dashboard and Compare badges say "1 improvement" / "1 regression" instead of "1 improvements"
- `release-gate.yml` reads the `TESTO_E2E_*` repository secrets, matching the nightly job, instead of the old `UQO_E2E_*` names
- Errors in I/O and reporting paths are no longer swallowed silently: `except Exception: pass` sites in `testo_core/` and `testo_api/` now catch the specific exceptions they expect and log with the module logger, and the deliberate catch-alls (orchestrator, reporter factory, API routes) log with a traceback. A failed BehaveX HTML report now sets the stage's `error` and is written to `run.log`, and a failed Git trigger evaluation logs a warning and says so in the trigger `reason` (exit codes unchanged)
- The frontend's top nav overflowed the page at phone width. Below 640px the nav links and the Advanced menu now collapse into a menu button (`aria-expanded`, closes on navigation and Escape), and page gutters shrink to 16px; no page of the demo scrolls sideways at 390px any more
- Dashboard trends and "Compare latest two" (dashboard and Runs page) compared the latest run with whatever ran before it, even another cycle; the baseline is now the previous run of the same cycle, and the dashboard names it. A cycle whose stage crashed without producing results no longer reports the other stages' pass rate (often 100%) as its health
- The API's execution registry kept every execution in memory forever and each SSE viewer held a worker thread while polling `events.ndjson` every 0.2 s. Finished executions beyond `TESTO_MAX_FINISHED_EXECUTIONS` (default 200) are now evicted (their status/events endpoints return 404 pointing to `/api/v1/runs`); the SSE tail is an async generator with poll backoff (0.1 s to 2 s) that closes right after the run's own last event (not the next run's, which shares `events.ndjson`) or when the client disconnects, and no longer drops a line caught mid-write
- The test pyramid (`testo report pyramid`, `/api/v1/runs/{id}/pyramid`) bucketed a run by the tiers in the *current* `testosterone.yaml`, so renaming a stage re-counted old runs as "unit". Run records now store each stage's `tier`; only older records without one fall back to the YAML
- A `command` stage's `junit_xml:` reports were never imported by `testo run` or the API, so the stage showed 0 tests and PASS. Cycle resolution and the `--workers` override rebuilt each stage without its `junit_xml` and `tier`; they now copy the stage with `dataclasses.replace`
- Pytest stages ignored the target repo's own pytest config (`pythonpath`, markers) when the target sat inside another pytest project, such as a repo cloned into the testosterone checkout in CI, so tests failed to import the target's code. The adapter passed `--alluredir <path>` as two tokens, and pytest counted the results path when choosing its rootdir; it now passes `--alluredir=<path>`
- Compare's test-level changes were always empty for two runs of the same cycle, and a run's artifact download returned whichever run of that cycle came last. Run records pointed `snapshot_dir` at the shared `artifacts/<cycle>/` tree, which every run overwrites; each run now keeps its own copy at `static/history/<run_id>/artifacts/`
- Frontend typecheck errors surfaced by the generated types: `/health/ready` is typed `"ready" | "degraded"` as the API returns, and `StatusPill` handles a `null` status
- `mypy testo_core` reports 0 errors, down from 59: reporters take a typed Rich `Console`, `testo report` narrows its optional open path before use, and the persistence, repository and CLI UI code is fully annotated
- `equipment: behavex`: every BehaveX stage failed at startup with `OSError: AF_UNIX path too long`, because BehaveX points `TEMP` at its output folder and the multiprocessing socket landed there; the adapter now pins `TMPDIR` to the system temp dir
- API errors surfaced in the UI as `API error <status>`; the client now shows the message the API returned, and the Run detail page reports a failed AI-summary request instead of swallowing it
- Run detail, dashboard and compare showed a wall duration of 0 ms for every cycle run; engine-sourced records store `duration_s`, which the history view now falls back to

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-27

First public release. Published to PyPI (`testo-core`), GHCR (`testo-runner`), and JFrog Artifactory.

### Deprecated
- `testo-ui` / Streamlit interface: prints a deprecation notice on stderr and is scheduled for removal in v1.1. The React frontend (`frontend/`) is the official UI.
- `uqo` CLI alias: continues to forward to `testo`; removal in a future release.

### Added
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: local `ruff`, changelog-format, and whitespace/YAML/TOML hooks (`pre-commit install` to enable)
- `mypy` type-check tooling: `[tool.mypy]` config in `pyproject.toml`, advisory step in `ci.yml`'s `format` job
- Extended `[tool.ruff.lint]` selection (added `UP`, `B`) and made `ruff check` blocking in `ci.yml` now that the tree is clean
- `changelog_required` CI gate in `ci.yml`: fails PRs with non-doc changes that don't touch `CHANGELOG.md` (escape hatch: `no-changelog` label)
- `commitlint` CI check (`.github/workflows/commitlint.yml`, `commitlint.config.js`) enforcing Conventional Commits on PR commit messages
- `changelog-on-main.yml`: AI-drafted `CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased]` entries on push to `main`, gated by `scripts/check_changelog_format.py` — see `docs/changelog_automation_policy.md` for the review-step tradeoff and required secrets/branch-protection setup
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (bug report, feature request), and `CODEOWNERS`
- Root-level `CLAUDE.md` pointing any directly-invoked AI agent at `docs/Index.md` and the Agent Context Guide
- Persistence module with `PersistenceBackend` protocol, JSON and DB backends
- Single-sourced `EngineExitCode` across modern and legacy execution stacks
- Contract tests asserting exit code consistency between stacks
- Execution stack boundary documentation in Architecture Overview
- `_SENSITIVE_KEY_PATTERN` in `redaction.py` to detect sensitive mapping keys (#35)
- `_redacted_context_text()` in `failure_context_builder.py` for structured metadata redaction (#35)
- Allure failure context wiring in `record_completed_run()` for run recording (#35)
- `equipment: command`: run any test runner (Jest, Playwright, Maestro, `go test`, ...) as a stage. `args` is the full argv
- Stage key `junit_xml` (glob or list, relative to `target_repo`): JUnit XML written by the stage is converted into Allure results after it exits, so non-Allure runners count in summaries, health % and every reporter (`testo_core/reporting/junit_import.py`)
- `artifactory-publish.yml`: mirrors the release to JFrog Artifactory (PyPI + Docker repos), inert until `ARTIFACTORY_URL` is set — see `docs/Processes & Guides/Publishing to Artifactory.md`

### Changed
- `--no-persist` / `--persist` CLI flags with clarified semantics
- `classify_exit_code` consolidated into `engine/exit_codes.py`
- Literal exit code constants in CLI replaced with `EngineExitCode` enum

### Fixed
- Sprint 2 release gate execution across all 4 phases
- Contract test assertion mismatch (`--plan` vs `--cycle`)
- Allure CLI unit test mock for `resolve_allure_command`
- `publish.yml`: post-publish verification installed `testo-core==v1.0.0` from the raw git tag, which is not a valid version specifier; the leading `v` is now stripped
- `docker-publish.yml`: Trivy scan and verify steps referenced an image tag that never existed (`docker/metadata-action` strips the `v`); both now use the resolved metadata version
- `docker-publish.yml`: the `latest` tag was gated on `is_default_branch`, which is never true for a release event, so `latest` would never have been published
- `.gitattributes`: GitHub reported the repository as HTML because the generated 3.2 MB `artifacts/allure-report/index.html` outweighed all authored Python and TypeScript; generated and vendored paths are now excluded from language statistics
- `Dockerfile.testo-runner`: the image ran as root, which fails the release workflow's blocking Trivy config scan (DS002, HIGH); it now runs as an unprivileged `testo` user, and the entrypoint is `testo` instead of the deprecated `uqo` alias
